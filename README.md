## Pokemon Naming Game with MEVN stack

To start the project:

Go to client folder and start VueJs with:

```
    npm run serve
```

Go to server folder and start NodeJs with:

```
    npm run start
```

And start MongoDB server with:

```
    mongod
```

For getting Pokemon informations, I have used PokeAPI which can be accessed from https://pokeapi.co/
